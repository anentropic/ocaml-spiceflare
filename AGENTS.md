## Opening pull requests

When you open a pull request, ask the user whether it needs a review. If they say yes:

1. Mark the PR ready for review, since the review bot skips drafts.
2. Request a review from `anentropic-reviewbot`. Claude then posts inline comments and a summary on the PR.
3. Watch the PR and address the review comments and any CI failures as they come in, until CI is green and no blocking comments are left open.

To get another review after pushing fixes, request one from `anentropic-reviewbot` again.
